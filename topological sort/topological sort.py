# Topological Sort of a directed graph (a graph with unidirectional edges) is a linear ordering of its vertices 
# such that for every directed edge (U, V) from vertex U to vertex V, U comes before V in the ordering.

# Given a directed graph, find the topological ordering of its vertices.

# Example:
# Input: Vertices=4, Edges=[3, 2], [3, 0], [2, 0], [2, 1]
# Output: Following are the two valid topological sorts for the given graph:
# 1) 3, 2, 0, 1
# 2) 3, 2, 1, 0

# O(V + E) space: O(V + E)

# follow up
# Find if a given Directed Graph has a cycle in it or not.
# Solution: If we canâ€™t determine the topological ordering of all the vertices of a directed graph, 
# the graph has a cycle in it. This was also referred to in the above code:
# if len(sorted_order) != vertices: return []
