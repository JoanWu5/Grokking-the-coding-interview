# There is a dictionary containing words from an alien language for which we donâ€™t know the ordering of the characters. 
# Write a method to find the correct order of characters in the alien language.

# Example:
# Input: Words: ["ba", "bc", "ac", "cab"]
# Output: bac
# Explanation: Given that the words are sorted lexicographically by the rules of the alien language, so
# from the given words we can conclude the following ordering among its characters:
# 1. From "ba" and "bc", we can conclude that 'a' comes before 'c'.
# 2. From "bc" and "ac", we can conclude that 'b' comes before 'a'
# From the above two points, we can conclude that the correct character order is: "bac"

# O(V + N) space: O(V + N)
