# Given an array containing 0s, 1s and 2s, sort the array in-place. 
# You should treat numbers of the array as objects, hence, we canâ€™t count 0s, 1s, and 2s to recreate the array.

# The flag of the Netherlands consists of three colors: red, white and blue; 
# and since our input array also consists of three different numbers that is why it is called Dutch National Flag problem.

# Example:
# Input: [1, 0, 2, 1, 0]
# Output: [0 0 1 1 2]
